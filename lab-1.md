## More resources!

You might be interested in workshops 1 through 5 of [Intro to Remote Computing](https://ngs-docs.github.io/2021-august-remote-computing/). Warning, this was written mostly by Titus ;). There are video recordings available.

You might also be interested in the Grad Pathways Microcredentialing in Research Computing - [(link)](https://gradpathways.ucdavis.edu/research-computing-pathway). Hit me up by e-mail if you're interested!

DataLab runs a bunch of [workshops](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/workshops/) that you might be interested in, as does the [Genome Center Bioinformatics Core](https://bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/training). The DataLab workshops are free, the GC ones are not. This course will prepare you well, and/or complement, these workshops!

The book [Bioinformatics Data Skills](https://vincebuffalo.com/book/) is an excellent reference that is worth buying if you are looking to invest ;).
